# DataHIT
Data Human Intelligence Task

DataHIT is a single function tool which can be used to solicit and validate structured data (JSON) from humans working on a collaborative project and store it in an ElasticSearch index where it can be accessed by machines.

## Roadmap
This was written with identity management and permissions in mind, but it is not fully implemented yet. I may or may not get around to doing that.
